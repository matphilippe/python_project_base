# Yet another (python) template

A simple python project template.
The design aims at making it easy to package python-built tools as docker image.

There are probably other alternatives, but I tend to land here often, and make experiments within projects.
I find the need to have some minimalistic playground where to grow common needs into documented actions, scripts, and snippets.
